## Features

- Ignores your .git directory and children of directories listed in your .gitignore
  > This means this extension won't print out your whole .git or node_modules directory.
  > ![.env ignored](images/ignored.png)
- Supports multiple nested .gitignore files
- Highlights your ignored files, which can for debugging which files your .gitignore is targeting.

Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.
